# About

Exploring [Rantly](https://github.com/hayeah/rantly) by trying to implement
a few QuickCheck examples (e.g. from [An introduction to QuickCheck with number
theory and red black trees](http://matt.might.net/articles/quick-quickcheck/)).

# Usage

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test

For Ruby, there are different implementations:

  * [Rantly](https://github.com/hayeah/rantly)
  * [RushCheck](https://github.com/IKEGAMIDaisuke/rushcheck), closer to original QuickCheck than Rantly.
  * [RubyCheck](https://github.com/mcandre/rubycheck)
